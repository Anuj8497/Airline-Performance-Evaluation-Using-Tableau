In this project, my teammates and I extracted and cleaned the data of various airlines of over one year and created visuals to identify 
the flight delay patterns. Evaluated the flight delay pattern of SkyWest airlines to determine the reasons behind the flight delays and 
came up with recommendations to reduce the delays.

The .twbx file being large (>25 mb) cannot be directly uploaded. So I've shared the google drive link in the doc file.
